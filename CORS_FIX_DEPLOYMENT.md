# CORS Fix Implementation - Deployment Guide

## Problem Solved âœ…

**Issue**: Direct browser calls to Replicate API were blocked by CORS policy
**Solution**: Implemented server-side API proxy using Vercel serverless functions

## What Was Changed

### 1. Backend API Proxy (`/api/replicate.js`)
- Created Vercel serverless function to proxy Replicate API calls
- Handles authentication server-side (API key never exposed to browser)
- Implements proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Supports both `createPrediction` and `getPrediction` actions

### 2. Frontend Service Update (`src/services/replicate.ts`)
- Modified to call our backend API instead of Replicate directly
- Removed direct Replicate SDK usage from frontend
- Added development mode detection with helpful error messages
- Maintains all existing functionality (retry logic, error handling, etc.)

### 3. Environment Variables
- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` (server-side only, no VITE_ prefix)
- `FRONTEND_URL` (for production CORS configuration)

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Vercel

```bash
# Add to Vercel dashboard or use Vercel CLI:
vercel env add REPLICATE_API_TOKEN production
# Enter your Replicate API token: [YOUR_REPLICATE_TOKEN]

vercel env add FRONTEND_URL production  
# Enter your domain: https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

### 3. Test the Integration

1. Upload a product image
2. Fill in brand information  
3. Click "Generate 4 Scenes"
4. Verify images are generated using your uploaded product photo

## Development vs Production

### Development (localhost)
- Shows helpful notice: "Image generation requires deployment to test"
- All UI functionality works for testing
- API calls return development mode error with instructions

### Production (Vercel)
- Full image generation functionality enabled
- Server-side Replicate API integration
- No CORS issues
- Secure API key handling

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Security**: API key never exposed to browser
2. **Performance**: Server-side processing reduces browser load
3. **Reliability**: Proper error handling and retry logic
4. **Scalability**: Serverless functions auto-scale
5. **Compliance**: Follows web security best practices

## Testing Checklist
